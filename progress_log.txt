INTERIM REPORT 1

I have worked on the Graphical-User Interface for the program. The Graphical user interface can now show different maps,
health of king tower and other different stats. There was not a lot to test in this part of the project other than some
visual inspections. The most challenging part was aligning all the different GUI elements properly and displaying the
game map in the right amount of space. This required a lot of careful adjustments, but it is finally done and the program
can properly load a map using a 2D Array.

The total workload for this part was about 10 hours which is roughly the time I expected this part to take. I am a bit behind
the schedule mentioned in the technical plan as I still need to work on adding towers and enemies in the GUI. I also need to
create some sort of welcome scene, but I'll do that later when I'm finalising the looks and selecting desgins for enemies and
towers. That said, the core part of the GUI needed for testing other elements is ready, and I'll start working on the enemy and
tower classes now.

INTERIM REPORT 2

These last two weeks, I worked on the game functionality and implemented classes Game, Tower, Enemy, and Projectile. The game can
now have enemies that move, and towers that shoot projectile. I also refined the game map a bit and created a method that converts from the map
that would be stored in a file to a map made of grid positions. I encoded the directions for the enemy to follow in the file-save map which
is extracted by a function and grid positions are paired with the direction in which the enemy should go. Enemies should also be able to
take damage now from the projectiles fired from the towers but this has not yet been tested. I have not yet written any tests for the
functionalities, but I'm planning on doing that next week.

Overall, these last 2 weeks were quite fun, but I had a finnish exam and a lot of other assignments to do, so I did not get enough time to complete
all the things I planned. Still, I managed to complete about 90% of the things I needed to do. The workload was about 15 hours.
I now need to implement the resource collector class and add the functionality of adding towers by mouse click.
I would then work on creating different levels and maps for the game.


INTERIM REPORT 3
The project has progressed relly nicely, and it is in its last stage now. Levels can be created now which define
how the enemies are spawned. The player can now select and place towers on the map. The game maps and levels can
properly be read from and stored to files. The enemy  killing mechanism also works now and the game also stops when
the player loses(enemies cross the map). Apart from this, the game can also be paused, but I still need to work on
a pause screen. The workload was about 20 hours, which was a bit less than what I initially expected. I did not find
any major bugs in the game right now but things like the projectile-enemy collision need some work.

I now have to add a flying type enemy and a tower type that attacks this enemy. I also need to work on making levels
and selecting good graphics for the game. Apart from this, I need to make some settings to be customizable by the user
and saving these custom settings in a file.

INTERIM REPORT 4
The game has now been finished! I added levels, a start screen and some instructions for the player. The are also some settings that the user can
change. Apart from this, I worked on the game over screen, from where the player can replay the same level or move on to the next one.
I also updated the graphics, and now the game uses better and low res-images. Some high resolution were causing some lag in the game but this
is fixed now.

This last phase took about 20 hours and I am finalizing the project now before submitting it.
