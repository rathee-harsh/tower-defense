I have worked on the Graphical-User Interface for the program. The Graphical user interface can now show different maps,
health of king tower and other different stats. There was not a lot to test in this part of the project other than some
visual inspections. The most challenging part was aligning all the different GUI elements properly and displaying the
game map in the right amount of space. This required a lot of careful adjustments, but it is finally done and the program
can properly load a map using a 2D Array.

The total workload for this part was about 10 hours which is roughly the time I expected this part to take. I am a bit behind
the schedule mentioned in the technical plan as I still need to work on adding towers and enemies in the GUI. I also need to
create some sort of welcome scene, but I'll do that later when I'm finalising the looks and selecting desgins for enemies and
towers. That said, the core part of the GUI needed for testing other elements is ready, and I'll start working on the enemy and
tower classes now.
